            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Transistor Tunes , where our passion for vintage technology meets the nostalgia of the past.
            </p>
            <p>Founded in 2023, our mission is to preserve and share the history of transistor radios from the early
                20th century. We believe in the beauty of these timeless devices that revolutionized the way people
                listened to music and news.</p>
            <p>At Transistor Tunes , we curate a collection of classic transistor radios, showcasing their innovative
                designs and the craftsmanship of a bygone era. Each radio in our collection tells a unique story,
                reflecting the creativity and ingenuity of the inventors and engineers who paved the way for modern
                portable audio.</p>
            <p>Our team is dedicated to providing you with a glimpse into the past, offering carefully selected
                transistor radios for enthusiasts, collectors, and anyone who appreciates the charm of vintage
                technology.</p>
            <p>Before the transistor was invented, radios used vacuum tubes. Although portable vacuum tube radios were
                produced, they were typically bulky and heavy. The need for a low voltage high current source to power
                the filaments of the tubes and high voltage for the anode potential typically required two batteries.
                Vacuum tubes were also inefficient and fragile compared to transistors and had a limited lifetime.

                Bell Laboratories demonstrated the first transistor on December 23, 1947.<br><br>The scientific team at
                Bell Laboratories responsible for the solid-state amplifier included William Shockley, Walter Houser
                Brattain, and John Bardeen After obtaining patent protection, the company held a news conference on June
                30, 1948, at which a prototype transistor radio was demonstrated.

                There are many claimants to the title of the first company to produce practical transistor radios, often
                incorrectly attributed to Sony (originally Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). Texas
                Instruments had demonstrated all-transistor AM (amplitude modulation) radios as early as May 25, 1954,
                but their performance was well below that of equivalent vacuum tube models. <br><br>A workable
                all-transistor radio was demonstrated in August 1953 at the Düsseldorf Radio Fair by the German firm
                Intermetall. It was built with four of Intermetall's hand-made transistors, based upon the 1948
                invention of the "Transistor"-germanium point-contact transistor by Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker.
                However, as with the early Texas Instruments units (and others) only prototypes were ever built; it was
                never put into commercial production. RCA had demonstrated a prototype transistor radio as early as
                1952, and it is likely that they and the other radio makers were planning transistor radios of their
                own, but Texas Instruments and Regency Division of I.D.E.A., were the first to offer a production model
                starting in October 1954. <br><br>
                The use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes as the amplifier elements meant that the device was much
                smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio, and was more resistant to physical shock.
                Since the transistor's base element draws current, its input impedance is low in contrast to the high
                input impedance of the vacuum tubes.[10] It also allowed "instant-on" operation, since there were no
                filaments to heat up. The typical portable tube radio of the fifties was about the size and weight of a
                lunchbox and contained several heavy, non-rechargeable batteries—one or more so-called "A" batteries to
                heat the tube filaments and a large 45- to 90-volt "B" battery to power the signal circuits. By
                comparison, the transistor radio could fit in a pocket and weighed half a pound or less, and was powered
                by standard flashlight batteries or a single compact battery. The 9-volt battery was introduced for
                powering transistor radios </p>
