            <h1>Exploring the Evolution of Transistor Radios</h1>
            <p>The history of the radio is much older than most of us. What we call a radio today dates back to as far
                as the early 20th century.

                From its inception, the radio has remained an efficient means of mass communication to date.

                Although it may not be as famous and renowned as this generation, it is still revered in information
                technology.<br><br>The invention of the broadcast radio was a technology that was greatly welcomed by
                the listening public due to its delightful privileges and potentials.

                It was the first medium that provided news to the public over the airwaves.

                Between 1920 and 1945, radio evolved into the first type of electronic information dissemination system
                for the masses.
                <br><br>
            <h2>Radio – How Was The Term or Name Coined? </h2>
            It won’t be easy to know how the term radio came
            into existence without looking at a brief history of radio.

            Scientists initially used the term ‘radio’ to explain electromagnetic radiations employed in innovations
            such as radio-telegraphy (this was a means of transmitting messages in the absence of poles, cables, or
            wires).

            Simply put, it was used to mean radiation or radiant.

            Between the years 1886 and 1888, Hertz undertook studies that indicated radio or electromagnetic waves could
            travel through an “ether” at an incredible speed – light’s speed.

            In the 1890s, scientists like Nicolas Tesla, Guglielmo Marconi, and a host of others developed transmitters,
            receivers, and conductors.

            That invention made it possible for Morse code messages to be transmitted between distant locations without
            any poles, wires, or cables.

            That was how the term ‘radio-telegraphy’ was born. Wireless telegrams were called radios or radio-grams.

            These terms help to explain why Marconi and Tesla were deemed to be responsible for what we describe as the
            wireless telegraph today.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Who Invented Radio?
            </h2>
            A handful of content online clearly shows a certain level of misconception on who invented the radio. Who
            invented the radio?

            In 1894, it was believed that a young Italian scientist by the name of Guglielmo Marconi woke up one morning
            with a deep craving for long-distance wireless communication.

            His ambitions could be traced to the existence of radio or electromagnetic waves.

            Marconi felt the world could do much more with radio waves than just thinking of them as electromagnetic
            waves.

            Therefore, he sourced as much literature as he could find. He combined that literature with the ideas of
            other scientists and ended up building the first set of portable transmitter and receiver devices.<br><br>
            These devices could function between distant locations. While Marconi can be credited for his invention, he
            built on the many experiments of his predecessor scientists.

            He was able to make a useful device out of what was formerly perceived as a mere experiment.

            A year later, Guglielmo Marconi had advanced his system enough for field testing.

            After several adjustments and tests, his devices could only do as much as transmitting signals to 1.5 miles.

            Interestingly, that same distance was predicted by Oliver Lodge to be the highest distance his radio signals
            were going to travel.<br><br>

            <h2>History of The Radio
            </h2>
            Right from its discovery before becoming what it is today, radio has evolved through various exciting
            phases.

            We will go through the different stages of development in this section.<br><br>
            <h3>1900</h3>
            In 1900, the first wireless transmission of the human voice was accomplished, thanks to Roberto Landell de
            Moura.

            He had undertaken a public exhibition before some journalists on the 3rd of June that year.

            Everything happened somewhere in Brazil, Sao Paulo. The signal was able to travel up to 8 kilometers.
            </p>
            <h3>1920</h3>
            The remarkable thing about radio in 1920 is that it was marked as the first time a news program was
            broadcast over the radio.That happened somewhere in Detroit, Michigan. It is a news station that CBS Network
            owned.

            It is equally on record that the first college station to broadcast also did that in 1920.<br><br>
            <h3>World War I
            </h3>
            Radio technology was still very young when WWI took place. Back then, the most sophisticated military
            gadgets could only manage short-range communications.

            The military radio was still using vacuum tubes for its operation.

            That means it was so large that you could hardly move it around.

            On that note, the Americans somehow tweaked the existing radio.

            They developed what was known as the horse-pack set, which employed a hand generator tied to a horse.

            Telegraphs or wired telephones were more reliable compared to radio transmissions during World War I.
            <br><br>
            <h3>1940</h3>
            1940 saw commercial television transmissions come into the limelight. It took off in Europe and North
            America.

            But before this time, radio has been used to transmit images that could be made visible on TVs.

            The 1940s also came to be known as the Age of Golden Programming for radio shows.<br><br>
            <h3>World War II</h3>
            Before the dawn of the Second World War, radio has become a common means of entertainment and information.

            As with every other aspect of the entertainment industry, the government had a firm grip on radio stations,
            which led to censoring many of their programs.

            Radio became the source of series of propaganda in WWII as authorities looked for any means to keep the
            spirits of its citizens high.<br><br>
            <h3>1980</h3>
            With the ongoing research in the 1970s, it was only a matter of time before the era of digital radio was
            born.

            As the 1980s came to an end, Asad Ali Abidi came up with a radio transceiver system that unveiled digital
            signal processing within wireless communications.

            It was a discovery that was going to give birth to more advanced radio technology.<br><br>
            <h3>2000</h3>
            As the 2000s gradually made way for us to access the 21st century, more advancements were going to behold
            radio systems.

            Radio broadcasting was going to have a new face. In the U.S., direct radios and DBS became known.

            That said, the most notable thing about the 2000s and radio is the introduction of internet radio.

            It was a stand-alone arrangement that let people listen to the radio without PCs.<br><br>
            <h3>2021</h3>
            In 2021, internet radio is no longer new. The technology has been perfected much better than it was two
            decades ago.

            In 2021, broadcast houses have adopted the act of extending their transmissions to live streaming on various
            platforms.

            It meant you could listen to a radio program you missed anytime you wish.<br><br>
            <h2>When were radio waves first used?
            </h2>
            After his demonstration in Sao Paulo, de Moura imagined he could benefit more by patenting his discovery in
            a place like the U.S.

            Fortunately; he got what he bargained for even though it was not an easy process.

            And that was what laid the foundation for radio broadcasting in America.

            Reginald Fessenden would be credited for the first radio waves that will hit the airwaves with the help of
            an asynchronous rotary-spark transmitter.

            It was the first official AM radio transmission, happening on the 24th of December, 1906.<br><br>
            <h2>What changes did the invention of the radio bring to Americans?
            </h2>
            Americans have had that long-standing reputation of being great lovers of sports.

            The Americans are not known for joking about their favorite sporting events.

            They never liked missing any sporting occasion, which meant that passionate fans always filled sporting
            venues to the brim.

            That was going to change with the introduction of radio broadcasting.

            So, people now had the choice of catching their favorite sports on the radio.

            It didn’t only reduce the number of attendees at the sporting venues but also made Americans feel more
            isolated.

            Most times, they listened to the programs alone, and a culture of isolation was born.
